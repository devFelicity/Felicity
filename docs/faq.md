Very kind of you to ask! We use your generous donations for various development tool licenses, API keys and hosting costs.

There are channels in our [Support Server :fontawesome-brands-discord:](https://discord.gg/JBBqF6Pw2z) where you can do these.<br>

Yes! We will never gatekeep our methods so if you have a question about how our Bungie API requests work for example, feel free to ask them in the [Support Server :fontawesome-brands-discord:](https://discord.gg/JBBqF6Pw2z).
